## About the Project
1. This tool utlises GazePointer: A Webcam eye tracker software that lets us determine the position of an individual's gaze on the screen. 
2. Using the GazeTracker API, we gather data, namely the GazeX and GazeY coordinates.
3. We then utlise these coordinates and key-binding techniques to perform a variety of on-screen interactive actions
