## About the Project
1. Eyetastic utlises GazePointer: A Webcam eye tracker software that lets us determine the position of an individual's gaze on the screen. 
2. Using the GazeFlow API, we gather data, namely the GazeX and GazeY coordinates.
3. We then utlise these coordinates and key-binding techniques to perform a variety of on-screen interactive actions 

### On-Screen Interactions
- [x] Move Window
- [x] Desktop Switching
- [x] Scrolling
- [x] Resizing


### How to use
1. Download GazePointer from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yuGFHnPVP8hCV2-qC6-u1R9OtL0Bzhre/view?usp=sharing)
2. Install and run GazePointer
3. Run the python script gazetest.py
